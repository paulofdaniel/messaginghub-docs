### Concepts

**Blip Messaging Hub** allows that messaging apps (here also called **chatbots**, bots, intelligent contacts, or just, contacts) be built only once and made available in different **messaging channels**, such as *Messenger*, *Skype* or [*BLiP App*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.take.omni) (a Blip's channel).

In order to allow the contact owner to perform his servicesâ€™ charge, there are integrations with **payment channels**, such as *Pagseguro*. It is not necessary to be a developer if he wants to use these functionalities, once the **templates** have an easy and friendly way for the owner to offer services that use all the platform functions, when he only needs a quick customization.

For developers, it is possible to choose between using **webhooks**, the simplest and fastest way to receive and send messages and notifications, or the **SDKs** that enable to build contacts in a flexible and scalable way.

Developers also can use on **extensions** that encapsulate common functionalities used in message applications, such as *message broadcast* and *scheduling*.

**Blip Messaging Hub** uses [protocolo LIME](http://limeprotocol.org) for communication between chatbots and customers, great part of the concepts comes from this protocol. The **envelops** are information *containers* defined by the protocol and can be **message**, **notifications** and **command**, sent in **JSON** format.
