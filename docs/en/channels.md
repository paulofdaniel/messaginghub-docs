### Channels

**Channels** are message networks connected to the **BLiP Messaging Hub** where **chatbots** can receive and send messages to clients' network. Each domain has an identifier used for addressing, located before of address `@` character.

In order to traffic envelopes (messages, commands and notifications) in a channel, a chatbot must be published to it, being the publication done through the [portal](https://portal.blip.ai). At the time of the publication, specific settings of the application may be required. Configuration is made through the portal, where some specific channel information, such as the APIs’ **tokens** for example, will be requested. It is necessary to fullfill a previous registration form on each channel, normally through the supplier’s site. 

Each channel has different capabilities like supported message formats or notification events.
