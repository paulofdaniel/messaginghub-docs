### Notifications

A **notification** provides information about a sent message.

Each notification has:

- **id**: Identifier of the related message.
- **from**: Notification originator’s address. A notification may be generated by the server (`postmaster@msging.net`) or by the final customer, depending on the **event**.
- **to**: Notification recipient’s address. 
- **event**: Event related to the message. The recipient’s events depend on the channel and they may not be available. The valid values are: 
  * **accepted**: The message has been accepted by the server.
  * **dispatched**: The message has left the server and was dispatched to recipient.
  * **received**: The recipient has received the message.
  * **consumed**: The recipient has read the message.
  * **failed**: The message has failed. In this case, the property **reason** must be present. 
- **reason**: The reason why message has failed. 

See bellow the JSON representation of a receipt notification from the destination:
