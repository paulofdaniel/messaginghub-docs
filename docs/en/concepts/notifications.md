### Notifications

One **notification** provides information about a sent message.

Each notification has:

- **id**: Identifier of the related message.
- **from**: Notification Originator’s address. A notification may be generated by the server (`postmaster@msging.net`) or by the final customer, depending on the  **event**.
- **to**: Notification Recipient’s address. 
- **event**: Event related to the message. The recipient’s events depend on the channel, they may not be available. The valid values are: 
  * **accepted**: Message has been accepted by the server.
  * **dispatched**: Message has left the server and was dispatched to recipient.
  * **received**: Recipient has received the message.
  * **consumed**: Recipient has read the message.
  * **failed**: Message has failed. In this case, the property **reason** must be present. 
- **reason**: The reason why message has failed. 

Check the JSON representation of a receipt notification at the recipient:

```json

{
  "id": "65603604-fe19-479c-c885-3195b196fe8e",
  "from": "551199991111@0mn.io/182310923192",
  "to": "mycontact@msging.net",
  "event": "received"
}

```

And of a fail at the server:

```json

{
  "id": "65603604-fe19-479c-c885-3195b196fe8e",
  "from": "postmaster@msging.net/server1",
  "to": "mycontact@msging.net",
  "event": "failed",
  "reason": {
    "code": 42,
    "description": "Destination not found"
  }
}

```
