The **broadcast** extension allows creation and management of distribution lists and their members for sending messages to multiple destinations simultaneously. 

Each distribution list has a unique address in the format `list-name@broadcast.msging.net` in addition to the members, who are the recipients of messages sent to this list. Only the chatbot that created a remote list has permissions to send messages to it.

Notifications are forwarded to the chatbot when received by the extension.

#### Default lists

BLiP automatically creates a distribution list with all clients that have already contacted your chatbot. Its address is `[identifier]+senders@broadcast.msging.net` where `identifier` is the identifier of your chatbot, which is used with the access key for authentication.

For example, for a chatbot with identifier `mychatbot`, this list address would be `mychatbot+senders@broadcast.msging.net`.

#### Replacement variables

It is possible to use contact replacement variables in the sent messages. For more information, please check the documentation of the [**Contacts** extension](https://portal.blip.ai/#/docs/extensions/contacts).
