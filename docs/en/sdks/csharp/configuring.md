### Configuring

The configuration of your chatbot is made on `application.json` file. Basically this file define all `receivers` and others control properties.

Check a example of how to set your `application.json` file:

```json
{
  "identifier": "xpto",
  "accessKey": "cXkzT1Rp",
  "messageReceivers": [
    {
      "type": "PlainTextMessageReceiver",
      "mediaType": "text/plain"
    }
  ]
}
```

For this case the client was configured to use a chatbot with `xpto` identifier with `cXkzT1Rp` accessKey. Besides that was registered a **MessageReceiver** with name `PlainTextMessageReceiver` and a filter for messages with `text/plain` **media type**.

Through of `application.json` file the developer can realize a tranparent run of the application. All the other tasks are managed by `mhh.exe` BLiP tool, installed with the template package.

All possible properties of the `application.json` file:
