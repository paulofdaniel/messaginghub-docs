### Content Types

**Blip Messaging Hub** utilizes types of message content defined by LIME protocol and performs these type's conversion to the most adequate format on each channel. Each channel has a MIME type and a JSON schema presented in this documentation and in the SDKs. For more details, check the [LIME protocol content types](http://limeprotocol.org/content-types.html) specification.

It's also possible send **native contents** to some channels, like Messenger. With this feature is possible use any kind of channel's resource without restrictions. See more details on **native contents** item on left menu.
