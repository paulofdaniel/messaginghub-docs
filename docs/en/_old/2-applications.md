**Applications** or **message smart contacts** are the elements of the Messaging Hub that receives and send messages throught a connection. Each one have an unique name, that is used for message addressing and an API key that allows the connection by developers.

The creation and management of applications are made in the [portal](http://messaginghub.io), where the developers have access to information like usage statistics, domains and connected services.

When building an application, the developer can use existing **services** that are available in the Messaging Hub, which must be configured for each application. For instance, when building an application for sending news, the developer can use an existing broadcast service. For this, he must activate this service for the application and provide the service's required configuration via the portal.

Finally, the application should be published in a **domain** for receiving and sending messages. The publication in a domain works like similarly to the services and may require specific configuration of each domain that are also provided in the portal.
